# savethefish
Erasmus+ project for Arrabal (https://asociacionarrabal.org).
It is about clearing the oceans and saving fishes living in it. Catch the garbage before it falls to the ground, also be careful not to hurt the fishes! The point of the game is to draw your attention to the problem of pollution that threatens the aquatic environments of our planet and keep you entertained in the process.
